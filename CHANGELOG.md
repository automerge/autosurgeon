## `0.7.1`

No changes, this release is the same as 0.7.0, but I (Alex) published the wrong
code to crates.io for 0.7.0 due to being quite sleepy so I had to yank and 
publish 0.7.1

  document which are not part of the incoming data

## `0.6.0`

  `Uuid`.

## `0.4.0`

* Delete old keys when reconciling a new enum variant which has different keys
